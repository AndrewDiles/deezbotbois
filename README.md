## Deez Bot Bois

The goal of this project is to create an interface where users can:
- Assemble robots from a collection of frames, power sources, weapons, etc
- Use a UI to script a robot's response to combat based on triggers and knowledge
- Progress through levels against already scripted robots
- Gain drops from said levels based on performance
- Gather in-game currency based on performance and daily log in bonuses
- Use in-game currency to progress through a tree and unlock other features
- Participate in tournament styles PvP with other players

# Note

Players do not actively control robots during battles.
Instead, the robots are all scripted and take one action per battle tick

## GUI

Intentions with the GUI include:
- An expanding screen opening on first load of the page
- Capacity to toggle nav bar between top and left of screen
